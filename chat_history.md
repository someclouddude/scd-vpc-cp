**Ian:** We are 2 senior cloud infra and platform engineers.

**Copilot:** Great! How can I assist you with your cloud infrastructure or platform engineering tasks today? If you have a specific project, problem, or goal in mind, let me know and I’ll get to work.

**Ian:** We need to create a vpc for AWS together. The requirements are:
Created in opentofu
3 AZs
3 sets of subnets public, private, k8s
use arm based instances of size small since it's light traffic for NAT instances instead of NAT GW
Diagram of environment
Github actions to deploy the tofu

**Copilot:** Here’s a plan to fulfill your requirements for an AWS VPC using OpenTofu:

1. VPC and Subnets:  
   - Create a VPC.
   - 3 Availability Zones.
   - For each AZ: 1 public, 1 private, 1 k8s subnet.

2. NAT Instances:  
   - Use small ARM-based EC2 instances as NAT in each AZ (instead of NAT Gateway).

3. Diagram:  
   - Generate a diagram of the environment.

4. CI/CD:  
   - Set up GitHub Actions workflow to deploy with OpenTofu.

I’ll start by scaffolding the OpenTofu configuration for the VPC, subnets, and NAT instances. Then I’ll generate a diagram and a GitHub Actions workflow.

Let’s check if there are any existing files or modules in your workspace to reuse, and then I’ll scaffold the necessary files.

**(Copilot creates tofu/ directory and scaffolds main.tf, outputs.tf, variables.tf, vpc.tf, nat.tf, routes.tf, and .github/workflows/deploy-tofu.yml)**

**(Copilot generates a diagram at generated-diagrams/scd-vpc-nat-diagram.png.png)**

---

**Copilot:** Your AWS VPC environment is scaffolded for OpenTofu with:
- 3 AZs, each with public, private, and k8s subnets
- Small ARM-based NAT EC2 instances (one per AZ)
- A diagram of the architecture (see `generated-diagrams/scd-vpc-nat-diagram.png.png`)
- GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD deployment with OpenTofu

You can now review, customize, and deploy. Let me know if you want to adjust subnet CIDRs, add k8s resources, or need anything else!

**Ian:** can you add the full history of this chat to a file named chat_history.md?
